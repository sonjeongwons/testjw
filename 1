Error: 
 Problem: package gd-devel-2.2.5-7.el8.x86_64 from scf-package-repo requires libwebp-devel(x86-64), but none of the provi
ders can be installed
  - cannot install the best candidate for the job
  - nothing provides libwebp(x86-64) = 1.0.0-10.el8 needed by libwebp-devel-1.0.0-10.el8.x86_64 from scf-package-repo
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
