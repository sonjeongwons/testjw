      > No matching variant of org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.1.3 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 8, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.4' but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.1.3 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 8
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4')
          - Variant 'javadocElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.1.3 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:

                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)
